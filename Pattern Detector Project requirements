# pattern detector design
- Design and implement a “Pattern Detector” module that is used to detect the following pattern: 11010
(starting from the left). Pattern detectors have two types: overlapping and non-overlapping.
- When receiving the stated pattern, the pattern_found output should be asserted for 1 clock cycle after
receiving the last 0 bit of the pattern.
- Simple testbench
